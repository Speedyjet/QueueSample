# QueueSample
Tasks 1 (Required):

Introduction

In this task we will create a system for continuous processing of scanned images. 

Traditionally such systems consist of multiple independent services. Services could run on the same PC or multiple servers. For instance, the following setup could be applied: 

Data capture service. Usually, data capture services have multiple instances installed on the multiple servers. The main purpose of these services is documents capturing and documents transferring next to the image transformation servers. 
Image transformation services. Also, there can be multiple instances for balancing workload. Such services could perform the following image processing tasks like format converting, text recognition (OCR), sending to other document processing systems. 
Main processing service. The purpose of the service is to monitor and control other services (data capturing and image transformation). 
We will implement simplified model with 2 elements: Data capture service and Processing service. 

Notes! Please discuss with you mentor the following details prior starting the task: 

Which exact message queue to use (e.g., MSMQ/RabbitMQ/Kafka) 

High-level solution architecture  

* use console application as services 

Collecting data processing results 

Implement the main processing service that should do the following: 

Create new queue on startup for receiving results from Data capture services. 

Listen to the queue and store  all incoming messages in a local folder. 

Implement Data capture service which will listen to a specific local folder and retrieve documents of some specific format (i.e., PDF) and send to Main processing service through message queue. 

Try to experiment with your system like sending large files (300-500 Mb), if necessary, configure your system to use another format (i.e. .mp4). 

For learning purposes assume that there could be multiple Data capture services, but we can have only one Processing server.  

Notes 

One of the challenges in this task is that we have a limit for message size. Message queues have limits for a single message size.

Discuss your solution with mentor.

Task 2 (Optional):

Introduction

This task is an addition to the required task. The rRequired task should bemust be completed prior to starting the  complex task. 

Create UML diagrams for the solution from the required task: 
Component Diagram 
Sequence Diagram
Add elements which describe the principles of the provided below implementation provided below. 
Discuss diagrams and implementation details with your mentor: 
What patterns could be used to implement the missing part of the system? 
How system should behave in case of some services are being unavailable (i.e., restarting process of the message queue/processing service/data capture services)? 
Below you can find provided description of the centralized control system which extends the solution from the required task. 

Centralized control 

This mechanism allows to receive information from services about their statuses and send new settings to services if necessary. If service receives new settings, them should be applied for all new messages. 

Solution design: 

Capturing services periodically send current status to the Main processing service: 
Current service status (waiting for files/processing file) 
Current status: 
Max size of the message 
Additional info (if necessary) 
From Main processing service: 
Update status (force update before waiting for the status from the services) 
Change settings: 
Max size of the message 
Additional settings (if necessary)
